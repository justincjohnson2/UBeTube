## Contents

* *UBeTube_Processing_Guide.pdf* - Instructions for how to calibrate an UBeTube and then create a hydrograph from a time series of data collected from an UBeTube.
* *UBeTube_Processing.r*  - A R script to use as a template for calibrating and processing UBeTube data.
* *calibration_data.xls* - An example calibration dataset that is processed by the R script.
* *example_dataset.xls* - An example time series dataset of UBeTube water height measurments that is processed by the R script.
* *UBeTubeR_REM.Rproj* - A R project file that can be opened and stored with other files to help automatically set working directory where other files are stored. This file should be opened first before attempting to process data with the R script.
